summary: We ran off to New Georgia Estate in search of a haven, nothing good came out of that run. The same sleepless nights we experienced in Duala followed, with every penny we had, food was like gold dust (scarce). I sat down one afternoon and begin to ponder, am I going to sit here and die of starvation or should I take the risk and run back to Bushrod Island?

We ran off to New Georgia Estate in search of a haven, nothing good came out of that run. The same sleepless nights we experienced in Duala followed, with every penny we had, food was like gold dust (scarce). I sat down one afternoon and begin to ponder, am I going to sit here and die of starvation or should I take the risk and run back to Bushrod Island?
A few days later, I told my mom I was going for a stroll, with no hopes of finding food that day, I strolled to the riverbank looking directly into Caldwell New Georgia, so many things crossed my mind, way too many people drowned trying to cross over, I then asked myself "was I prepared to die seeking life or should I return to my supposed haven with hopes of going to bed on an empty stomach?" I stood at the riverbank for hours contemplating, it began to get dark, the skies fading away, people left one after another, courage left me, I felt like an infant that needed to run back into the arms of his mother for protection. But something in me said, stop being a coward, death is inevitable, it's either you go back and die of hunger or paddle through this river and save yourself.

So, I cultivated the zest, I could swim a little, a few people were still around, I said to myself, "it is whatever it is" and as it's common for most Catholics, I said the Lord's Prayer, signed my cross and jumped in with hopes of making it across the river. Certainly, I managed to. I didn't realize I was wet and funky at all, my head only had one thing disseminating, "wow I made it).
I then walked through the bushes meeting Rebels and checkpoints after every few minutes. It was even getting scarier and darkness was fast approaching, I grew sick in my fears, those guys frightened me all through my journey, I finally made it home in one piece. My first welcome was a looted house, I couldn't even find a spoon least to talk about cups or plates. A few friends were still in the community, they were all enthusiastic to see me, there was cooked food-wasting everywhere, alcohol was also in volume, (smile) I stuffed myself and in our usual Liberian saying, catch my head (drank to stupor).

Came back to the looted house and without fear slept right on the floor alone, I woke up the next morning to an entirely new me, the vigilant Waka Doe, I found an old gown laying somewhere in one of the rooms and four empty 5 gallons and a wheelbarrow. That was how I started selling beer. I'll head out to Beer Factory every morning, get fresh beer brewed from the fountain, and back to Duala Market to make some sales. It became lucrative and the community started calling me Kamajoh (because I could speak Creole fluently). I had a few friends who joined LURD so I used them as my shield every time I walked into Beer Factory. I was now known as the Kamajoh General within their circle, my business began to boom, I soon transitioned into toiletries from the profit I made from the beer sales.

Friends will come from town and I'll give them food, money, and booze. Living a carefree life was normal for me now, after my regular sales, I'll return home, cook and weâ€™ll sit outside with few girls, booze till we get tired, and sometimes sleep right outside. We were deprived of everything, but even at that, we still smiled and forgot our sorrows.
These memoirs live on, I know tons of people here share the same story, our future became bleak because of our selfish leaders, we became homeless, we lost our families and friends, it's about time we plead for justice, it is long overdue, we cannot sit back and allow people who committed all these atrocities to be moving around freely, while we live with the scars.

I am Desmond Waka Doe, I support a War and Economic Crimes and Court in Liberia.
