Local beer is all the rage these days. According to recent studies, more than 90% of Americans now prefer to buy products that are produced locally. The thirst for local beer is real, and it’s only growing stronger as consumers become more aware of their impact on the world around them. The benefits of drinking locally made beer go far beyond supporting your local brewery and its employees — there are plenty of positive side effects to drinking exclusively local brews. From environmental benefits to health advantages, there are plenty of reasons why you should be drinking local beer instead of imported lagers or mass-produced pale ales. Read on to find out why you should ditch the macro beers and stock up on delicious micro brews instead:

## You’ll be helping your local economy

When we purchase products from other countries, the wages from those sales go to the coffers of another nation. When we purchase products from [local brewery](https://www.monbrew.com/), the money stays in our own country and goes to keep our own economy afloat. When you purchase local beer, you’re supporting your local brewery and not a corporate monolith that’s exporting its profits overseas. By buying local, you’re helping to keep your money in your own community and supporting businesses that are working hard to create jobs and support families in your area. Buying local food and drink also means that you can get your goods more quickly in case of a shortage. While there is no guarantee that beer brewed locally will never go out of stock, you can rest assured that it will reach you much quicker than beer shipped in from overseas.

### The beer is fresher and tastes better

If you’ve ever purchased beer at the store and then cracked it open days or even weeks later, you know that it doesn’t taste the same as when you first purchased it. There are many factors that affect how fresh a beer is when you open it, but one of the most important is how quickly the beer is delivered from brewery to store shelves. When you buy beer that’s manufactured in a nearby country, it’s much easier for distributors to get the beer to the end users in a fresh state. When you purchase beer imported from a different country, you’ll often be waiting weeks or even months for the beer to get to your door. In addition to being fresher, locally brewed beer has a richer taste. Some experts believe that this is because the hops are more fresh—equating fresh hops to freshly ground black pepper—but others argue that it’s because local breweries tend to use more spring water than beer imported from other countries.

#### It benefits the ecosystem

Beer is one of the most resource-heavy beverages. It’s made from a variety of ingredients, including water, yeast, barley, and hops. When its ingredients are grown or manufactured, they can have an impact on the ecosystem. For example, the use of pesticides and herbicides on barley fields can hurt nearby animals and plants. In contrast, many breweries that make local beer use renewable energy, plant-based additives, and upcycled bottles to reduce their ecological impact. When you drink local beer, you’re supporting a more sustainable industry that’s working hard to reduce its ecological footprint. Many breweries use local barley and hops, which reduces the reliance on pesticides, saves water by cutting back on the need for irrigation, and reduces transportation times.

#### Local beer employees are paid well

The majority of the biggest beer manufacturers in the world have been accused of abusing or underpaying their employees. They have also been criticized for using unethical business practices and harming the environment. In contrast, many breweries that specialize in local beer offer their employees livable wages and comprehensive benefits. Some even offer bonuses for employees who use public transportation and contribute to their local economies. When you drink local beer, you’re supporting companies that care about their employees and want to do the right thing. When you buy beer from a small brewery, you’re supporting a company that’s often run by one or two people who are passionate about what they do. This is a significant difference from the giant corporations that dominate the beer industry. Local breweries often employ one part-time person, which means that health benefits are easy to provide. They also don’t have to offer pensions or contribute to Social Security for their employees, which can make the cost of running a small brewery much lower than you might expect.

#### You’ll be supporting small business

The beer industry is dominated by a handful of giant corporations that are notorious for their ruthless business practices. By purchasing beer made in your country, you’re helping a small business get off the ground and stay in your neighborhood. When you buy beer made in your country, you’re supporting small businesses that are run by people just like you—people who are passionate about what they do and want to make a living doing what they love. When you support small, local breweries, you’re contributing to the growth and success of the people who own the business. You’re also promoting an industry that is helping to build your local economy, reduce its reliance on imports, and become more self-sufficient. When you support small businesses, you’re also helping to keep money in your community, which benefits everyone and creates a better quality of life for everyone.

#### Conclusion

Overall, there are plenty of reasons why you should be drinking local beer. It’s fresher, it tastes better, it benefits the ecosystem, it supports small business, and it’s brewed and distributed locally. By drinking local beer, you’re supporting your local economy, keeping money in your community, and helping build stronger, more sustainable local businesses. There’s never been a better time to drink local beer. At the end of the day, drinking local beer supports small business, keeps money in your community, and reduces your carbon footprint. So why drink beer imported from other countries when you can support your neighbors and reap all these benefits?
