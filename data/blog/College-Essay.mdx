So you’ve decided to apply to college, and one of the required pieces of that application is a personal essay. You might be wondering what this essay is and why it’s so important. After all, won’t they see your transcript and resume when they read your application? But the personal essay is more than just another document. It’s your chance to stand out from the crowd and show exactly who you are as a person, not just as a student. A winning college personal essay can be the difference between an acceptance letter or rejection slip. The right personal essay can also open doors that may have been previously closed to you because of factors like socioeconomic status, race, gender identity, or sexual orientation. That's why we designed this ultimate guide on how to write a winning College Personal Essay.

### How to Write a Winning College Personal Essay

In order to write a winning college personal essay, you’ll want to get a firm understanding of the prompts that will be on the application. Colleges will vary a bit from one to another, but most will have these same prompts: - Why This College? - Why This Major? - What Are Your Strengths and Challenges? - What Is Your Greatest Achievement? - What Is Your Greatest Challenge? - What Is Your Most Meaningful Experiences? - Who Are You, and What Makes You Unique?

### Understand the prompts

The prompts are designed to get you thinking about how your own experiences and life journey have shaped the person you are today. They’re meant to be broad enough so that everyone can respond to them. You’re certainly not expected to have the same life experiences or have been through the same things as anyone else! This is your chance to let the reader know who you really are at your core.

### Start with a brainstorming exercise

Before you even consider picking up a pen to write, you’ll want to complete a brainstorming exercise. This can be done in a number of ways, but the idea is to give yourself some time to think about the kinds of topics you’d like to write about. Some helpful prompts to get you thinking: What’s most important to you? What are your core values? What do you believe in? What’s your biggest passion? What have you overcome? What’s your biggest regret? What do you hope for the future? What are your short-term goals? What are your long-term goals?

### Narrow your focus and decide on a topic

As you’re brainstorming topics and potential focuses for your essay, pay attention to which ones really “click” with you. You’ll want to pick a topic that resonates with you and that you feel confident in. This is your chance to be completely honest with the reader and show them everything that makes you, you. If you’re struggling to find inspiration, try looking at your life from a different perspective. You could also try going through an old photo album or journal to see if any memories trigger any ideas for topics. You don’t have to have the perfect idea from the start and you can always change your mind if something else inspires you better later on.

### Summarize your idea

Now that you have your topic decided on, you’ll want to sum it up in a single sentence. This is the core of your essay; it’s what you want to say to the admissions committee. Take your time, and make sure you’re happy with the wording and that it truly represents you. You don’t want to write a general summary that could apply to anyone. Your summary is a specific brief, tailored only to you.

### Build out your essay with supporting details

Now that you have your topic decided on, you’ll want to build out your essay with supporting details. You don’t want to write everything about your topic, but you do want to give detailed examples of it throughout your essay. Your supporting details help to flesh out your idea, and show the reader what you mean by it. Your essay should be like your resume; it should have some basic information about you and your life, but shouldn’t go into too many specifics. You want the reader to be intrigued and want to know more, but not be completely bored to tears.

### Don’t forget the conclusion

Your conclusion is your last chance to impress the reader and leave them with a lasting impression of you. It’s also the last chance to leave them with a strong takeaway from your essay. Again, be specific and don’t fall into the trap of using generalities. You want to leave them with a clear idea of who you are as a person, and how your life experiences have shaped you into the person you are today.

### Conclusion

Your conclusion is your last chance to impress the reader and leave them with a lasting impression of you. It's also the last chance to leave them with a strong takeaway from your essay.
