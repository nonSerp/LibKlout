Hepatitis is an inflammatory condition of the liver that is triggered by a virus, drug, or other toxin. There are different types of hepatitis, each with its own set of risk factors and symptoms. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most common causes of viral hepatitis globally. About 360 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV and 100 million people contract it every year. Hepatitis B is transmitted via exchange of bodily fluids like blood, semen, and saliva; hence, you can get this infection through unsafe sex practices and intravenous drug use. In fact, according to the CDC report in 2017, about 1 in every 19 Americans has chronic Hepatitis B infection.

### Symptoms of Hepatitis B

Some of the symptoms of hepatitis B include nausea, fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and dark urine. The symptoms of hepatitis B infection may not appear until months after you have been infected. You may even be unaware that you are infected if you do not get tested for it. It is important to know the symptoms of hepatitis B because they can be treated if they are caught early.

#### Causes of Hepatitis B

The hepatitis B virus is a bloodborne virus that is transmitted via exchange of bodily fluids like blood, semen, and saliva. HBV is a hepatotropic virus that infects and damages liver cells. The infection can be acute or chronic, depending upon the body’s immune response to the virus. Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus is present in the blood and bodily fluids of infected people. You can get the virus by coming into contact with these bodily fluids. It is common for people with chronic hepatitis B infection to not know they have it because they may not have any symptoms. Infected mothers can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth. A mother with hepatitis B can protect her baby by getting tested for the virus and treated with medicine to decrease the chance of transmission.

#### Risk Factors for Hepatitis B

An individual who has never been vaccinated against hepatitis B will test positive for the disease if they have ever been exposed to it. People who are at risk of contracting the disease include: People who have been exposed to the virus but have not been vaccinated: This could include health care workers, people with chronic liver disease, or parents of newborns. People who have had a blood transfusion before July 1992: Before this date, there was a high risk of contracting the disease. People who share needles: This applies to people who inject drugs and people in other high-risk groups, such as people who have tattoos. People with sexual partners who have hepatitis B infection: This applies to all people who are sexually active.

#### How You Can Protect Yourself from Getting Hepatitis B?

Here are some tips to prevent yourself from contracting hepatitis B: Get vaccinated: The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get vaccinated. In the United States, infants are vaccinated against hepatitis B at birth. People who were born outside of the United States should talk to their doctor about whether they need to be vaccinated. Use condoms: This is one of the best ways to prevent getting hepatitis B. If you have multiple sexual partners, it is important to use condoms to reduce the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B. Don’t share needles or other drug paraphernalia: If you inject drugs, do not share needles or other drug paraphernalia, including cottons, water, and spoons.

#### How to Diagnose and Monitor HBV?

To diagnose hepatitis B, your doctor will take a blood sample and test it for the presence of antibodies against the hepatitis B virus. Once you are diagnosed with hepatitis B, it is important to monitor your health and get tested regularly. Your doctor may recommend the following tests: Hepatitis B surface antibody: This test is done to confirm if you are infected with hepatitis B. Hepatitis B core antibody: This test is done to determine if you have been infected for a long time. Hepatitis B surface antigen: This test is done to determine the amount of virus in your blood. Hepatitis B virus DNA (genotype): This test is done to determine the subtype of hepatitis B virus that you have contracted.

#### Conclusion

Few people get tested for hepatitis B because they do not think of themselves as being at risk. You may not know that you have been exposed to the virus because you do not have any symptoms. You can get vaccinated against hepatitis B, but you cannot get the vaccine retroactively. It is important to get tested and know your hepatitis B status so you can protect your health.
