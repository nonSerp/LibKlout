## What is a Fitness Bootcamp?

A fitness boot camp is a short-term exercise program that combines both group and individualized training sessions to help people get fit as quickly as possible. Boot camps are usually only offered as short courses of 2-5 weeks, but they can be very effective in helping people get fit and stay motivated when they are done properly. Fitness boot camps are usually offered at gyms, yoga studios, sports facilities, and other fitness centers. A boot camp is different than a regular fitness class because it is a much more personalized experience. Boot camps usually work with small groups of people to make sure that each person is getting the exact level of intensity that is best for them. Boot camps are also usually only available for a limited amount of time. This is often done in order to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to get started with their fitness plans as quickly as possible when class starts.
